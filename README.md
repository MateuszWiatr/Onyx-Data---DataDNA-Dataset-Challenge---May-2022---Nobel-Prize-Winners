# Nobel Prize Data Dataset
This month we are analyzing historic Nobel Prize data!

The Nobel Prize is considered the most prestigious award in the world. 

It is awarded to ‘those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind’. Prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace have been awarded since 1901, and economic sciences since 1968.

Question: "Can you identify which country has won the most prizes in each category?"
